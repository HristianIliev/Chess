# Chess
A simple chess game that i made. Runs in the console and in order to move you have to type a command in the format "A7(location of the chess piece to move) A5(where you want it to go)"

  1. I couldn't implement a checker for checkmate so in order to win the game you have to take the enemy kind figure(which is just an extra turn anyway).
